# kindle-notes-extractor
Allows you to convert a txt file from kindle to a csv file which can be opened with google sheets

When you download pdfs on your kindle, highlighted text automatically gets saved to clippings.txt
The format of clippings.txt is really messy so I wanted to find a way to organize my highlighted notes
and upload it to a note taking app like notion for future reference.

Edited the code slightly for my own needs.

To use this, 
1) Replace clippings.txt with the txt file extracted from your kindle 
- this can be done using applications like Calibre
2) Run python extract.py in command line
